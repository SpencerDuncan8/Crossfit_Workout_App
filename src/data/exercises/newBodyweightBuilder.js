    setup: [
      "Start in a standard push-up position, but with your hands placed much wider than your shoulders.",
      "Engage your core and keep your body in a straight line."
    ],
    execution: [
      "Shift your weight to one side and lower your body towards that hand, keeping the primary arm tucked.",
      "The opposite arm will straighten out to the side, acting as a stabilizer (like an archer drawing a bow).",
      "Press back up to the center and then repeat on the other side.",
      "The goal is for the working side to handle most of the load."

    commonMistakes: [
      "Not shifting weight sufficiently, resulting in a wide push-up.",
      "Bending the stabilizing arm too much.",

    execution: [
      "Drive through the heel of the planted foot to lift your hips off the ground.",
