# BlockFit: Workout Tracker & Builder

A premium web application to guide your fitness journey. Get started immediately with professionally designed programs from the Template Library or use the powerful editor to create, plan, and track your own custom functional fitness workouts.

## üéØ Current Status: Complete Freemium Model & Template Library ‚úÖ

The application now features a complete freemium model with secure payment processing and a powerful, filterable Template Library. Users can experience the full app locally before upgrading to premium for cloud synchronization.

-   **Goal:** Provide a full-featured experience without requiring immediate sign-up, while enabling powerful cross-device synchronization for paid subscribers.
-   **Method:** The free tier saves all user data in **`localStorage`** for single-device use. Premium users get **Firebase Authentication** + **Cloud Firestore** sync across all devices.
-   **Security:** Users only gain cloud access **after** successful payment completion. Email addresses are captured for follow-up even if payment is abandoned.
