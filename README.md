# BlockFit: Workout Tracker & Builder

A premium web application to guide your fitness journey. Get started immediately with professionally designed programs or use the powerful editor to create, plan, and track your own custom functional fitness workouts.

## üéØ Current Status: User Testing - Phase 1 üß™

The application is currently in its first phase of user testing. The focus is on gathering feedback for the core workout building and tracking experience using **local browser storage**.

-   **Goal:** Validate the core features, find usability issues, and gather initial feedback.
-   **Method:** Testers are using a version of the app that saves all data directly to their browser's `localStorage`. This allows for a full-featured, single-device experience without requiring user accounts.
-   **Next Step:** Based on feedback from this phase, the core experience will be refined before moving to Phase 2, which includes implementing user authentication and cloud storage.
