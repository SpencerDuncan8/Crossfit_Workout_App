## ðŸš€ Features

### 1. Comprehensive Program Management
- **Template Library:** Browse pre-built programs like "Bodyweight Blast". Load them into your library or create an editable copy with a single tap.
- **Load & Auto-Schedule:** A "quick start" option instantly adds a template to your library and intelligently schedules its workouts onto your calendar, providing an immediate, structured plan.
- **Create From Scratch:** Build your own custom programs from the ground up, adding as many unique workouts as you need.
- **Full Customization:** For any program you own, easily rename the program, create new workouts, edit existing ones, or delete workouts you no longer need.

### 2. Powerful Workout Editor
- **Modular Blocks:** Build workouts using a variety of block types: Warm-up, Strength, Bodyweight, Accessory / Carry, Cardio, Cool-down, and multiple Conditioning formats.
- **Strength Blocks:** Define exercises with unique sets, reps, and load for each (e.g., 5x5, pyramid sets). Supports percentage-based loading (e.g., "5 reps at 85%") which automatically calculates weight based on your saved 1-Rep Max.
- **Bodyweight Blocks:** Track exercises by a target number of reps (e.g., 15 Push-ups) or by time (e.g., a 60-second Plank).
- **Accessory / Carry Blocks:** Specifically designed for accessory work, allowing you to define sets, weight, and distance or time (e.g., "3 sets of 50lb Farmer's Carry for 100 meters").
- **Conditioning Blocks:**
  - **AMRAP:** Set a time and list the exercises to perform.
  - **RFT (Rounds for Time):** Define a number of rounds and the exercises within each, backed by a full-featured lap timer.
  - **Chipper:** Create a high-rep list of exercises to be completed once for time, with a dedicated block timer to record your final score.
  - **EMOM (Every Minute On the Minute):** Define a unique task for every minute of the workout.
  - **Tabata:** Customize work/rest intervals and total rounds for high-intensity training.

### 3. Interactive Workout Experience
- **Dynamic Display:** The workout view automatically renders any workout you've scheduled, presenting it in clear, actionable cards.
- **Live Strength Tracking:** Log weight and reps for each set with easy +/- buttons. A checkbox marks the set as complete, providing visual progress.
- **1RM Percentage Calculation:** For percentage-based sets, the app displays the calculated target weight based on your saved 1-Rep Max, taking the guesswork out of training.
- **Context-Aware Integrated Timers:**
  - **Smart Start:** The app automatically launches the correct timer (Stopwatch, Countdown, AMRAP, EMOM, Tabata) based on the workout block you're on. A dedicated rest timer can be started between sets.
  - **Lap Timer for RFT:** For "Rounds for Time" workouts, a "Time Round" button appears on the timer bar, allowing you to log the time for each round.
  - **Dedicated Chipper Timer:** Chippers get a simple stopwatch with a "Record Time" button on the timer bar, letting you log the block's total time independently before moving on.
  - **Live Feedback:** Round times for RFTs and the final recorded time for Chippers are displayed in real-time directly within the relevant workout block.

### 4. Full-Featured Calendar & Logbook
- **Visual Workout Planner:** Click on any future date to open a modal and assign a workout from any program in your library. An indicator shows which workout is currently assigned.
- **Interactive Day Modal:** Click a scheduled day to either start the workout or change it.
- **Detailed Logbook:** After completing a workout, the calendar entry is marked as complete. Clicking it opens a review modal showing a summary of your performance, including total sets, reps, volume, and a detailed breakdown of any logged round times or final block scores.
- **Direct Navigation:** Easily jump between your scheduled workouts directly from the main Workout View using previous/next day buttons.

### 5. Advanced Progress Tracking
- **At-a-Glance Dashboard:** The dashboard displays key metrics: total workouts completed, lifetime lbs lifted, total reps, current weight, and weight lost.
- **1-Rep Max (1RM) Tracking:** A dedicated editor on the Progress screen to log your personal bests for key lifts (Squat, Bench Press, Deadlift, Overhead Press). This data directly powers the percentage-based calculations in your workouts.
- **Weight Logging & Charting:** Log your body weight over time and visualize your progress on a responsive chart that displays your journey with clear date labels.
- **Photo Progress Comparison:** Upload progress photos and compare your first and latest pictures side-by-side with an interactive slider.
