# BlockFit: Workout Tracker & Builder

A premium web application to guide your fitness journey. Get started immediately with professionally designed programs or use the powerful editor to create, plan, and track your own custom functional fitness workouts.

## üéØ Current Status: Cloud Sync Implemented ‚òÅÔ∏è

The application now supports both local-only use for free-tier users and full cloud synchronization for registered members. This hybrid approach allows new users to get started immediately without an account, with a seamless path to upgrade and sync their data across devices.

-   **Goal:** Provide a full-featured experience without requiring immediate sign-up, while enabling powerful cross-device synchronization for registered users.
-   **Method:** The free tier of the app saves all user-generated data directly to their browser's **`localStorage`**. This allows for a complete, single-device experience. When a user creates a permanent account, the app performs a **one-time migration** of all their local data to **Cloud Firestore**, linking it to their new account for cloud sync.
-   **Next Step:** Integrating Stripe for premium features and monetization.
